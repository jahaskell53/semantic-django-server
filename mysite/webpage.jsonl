{"text": ". The majority of modern sharks can be traced back to around 100 million years ago.[15] Most fossils are of teeth, often in large numbers. Partial skeletons and even complete fossilized remains have been discovered. Estimates suggest that sharks grow tens of thousands of teeth over a lifetime, which explains the abundant fossils. The teeth consist of easily fossilized calcium phosphate, an apatite. When a shark dies, the decomposing skeleton breaks up, scattering the apatite prisms. Preservation requires rapid burial in bottom sediments.\nAmong the most ancient and primitive shark-like fish is Cladoselache, from about 370 million years ago,[14] which has been found within Paleozoic strata in Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee. At that point in Earth's history these rocks made up the soft bottom sediments of a large, shallow ocean, which stretched across much of North America. Cladoselache was only about 1 metre (3.3\u00a0ft) long with stiff triangular fins and slender jaws.[14] Its teeth had sever"}

Its caudal fins had a similar shape to the great white sharks and the pelagic shortfin and longfin makos. The presence of whole fish arranged tail-first in their stomachs suggest that they were fast swimmers with great agility.\nMost fossil shark-like fish from about 300 to 150 million years ago can be assigned to one of two groups. The Xenacanthida was almost exclusive to freshwater environments.[16][17] By the time this group became extinct about 220 million years ago, they had spread worldwide. The other group, the hybodonts, appeared about 320 million years ago and lived mostly in the oceans, but also in freshwater.[citation needed] The results of a 2014 study of the gill structure of an unusually well preserved 325-million-year-old fossil suggested that sharks are not \"living fossils\", but rather have "}

In early white shark evolution there are at least two lineages: one lineage is of white sharks with coarsely serrated teeth and it probably gave rise to the modern great white shark, and another lineage is of white sharks with finely serrated teeth.

The Elasmobranchii also include rays and skates; the Chondrichthyes also include Chimaeras. It was thought that the sharks form a polyphyletic group: some sharks are more closely related to rays than they are to some other sharks,[26] but current molecular studies support monophyly of both groups of sharks and batoids.[27][28]\nThe superorder Selachimorpha is divided into Galea (or Galeomorphii), and Squalea (or Squalomorphii). The Galeans are the Heterodontiformes, Orectolobiformes, Lamniformes, and Carcharhiniformes. Lamnoids and Carcharhinoids are usually placed in one clade, but recent studies show the Lamnoids and Orectoloboids are a clade. Some scientists now think that Heterodo"}

The Hypnosqualea may be invalid. It includes the Squatiniformes, and the Pristorajea, which may also be invalid, but includes the Pristiophoriformes and the Batoidea.[26][29]\nThere are more than 500 species of sharks split across thirteen orders, including four orders of sharks that have gone extinct:[29][30]\n\nCarcharhiniformes: Commonly known as ground sharks, the order includes the blue, tiger, bull, grey reef, blacktip reef, Caribbean reef, blacktail reef, whitetip reef, and oceanic whitetip sharks (collectively called the requiem sharks) along with the houndsharks, catsharks, and hammerhead sharks.

The rate of tooth replacement varies from once every 8 to 10 days to several months. In most species, teeth are replaced one at a time as opposed to the simultaneous replacement of an entire row"}

The teeth of plankton-feeders such as the basking shark are small and non-functional.[33]\n\nSkeleton\nShark skeletons are very different from those of bony fish and terrestrial vertebrates. Sharks and other cartilaginous fish (skates and rays) have skeletons made of cartilage and connective tissue. Cartilage is flexible and durable, yet is about half the normal density of bone. This reduces the skeleton's weight, saving energy.[34] Because sharks do not have rib cages, they can easily be crushed under their own weight on land.[35]\n\nJaw\nThe jaws of sharks, like those of rays and skates, are not attach"}

It has a layer of tiny hexagonal plates called \"tesserae\", which are crystal blocks of calcium salts arranged as a mosaic.[36] This gives these areas much of the same strength found in the bony tissue found in other animals.\nGenerally sharks have only one layer of tesserae, but the jaws of large specimens, such as the bull shark, tiger shark, and the great white shark, have two to three layers or more, depending on body size. The jaws of a large great white shark may have up to five layers.[34] In the rostrum (snout), the cartilage can be spongy and flexible to absorb the power of impacts.\n\nFins\nFin skeletons are elongated and supported with soft and unsegmented rays named ceratotrichia, filaments of elastic protein resembling the horny keratin in hair and feathers.[37] Most sharks have eight fins.

This works as an outer skeleton, providing attachment for their swimming muscles and thus saving energy.[38] Their dermal teeth give them hydrodynamic advantages as they reduce turbulence when swimming.[39] Some species of shark have pigmented outer skin layers under the denticles that form complex patterns like spots (e.g. Zebra shark) and stripes (e.g. Tiger shark). These markings are important for camouflage and help sharks blend in with their environment, as well as making them difficult for prey to detect.[40] For some species, patterning returns to "}

Caudal fin shapes vary considerably between shark species, due to their evolution in separate environments. Sharks possess a heterocercal caudal fin in which the dorsal portion is usually noticeably larger than the ventral portion. This is because the shark's vertebral column extends into that dorsal portion, providing a greater surface area for muscle attachment. This allows more efficient locomotion among these negatively buoyant cartilaginous fish. By contrast, most bony fish possess a homocercal caudal fin.[42]\nTiger sharks have a large upper lobe, which allows for slow cruising and sudden bursts of speed. The tiger shark must be able to twist and turn in the water easily when hunting to support its varied diet, whereas the porbeagle shark, which hunts schooling fish such as mackerel and herring, has a large lower lobe to help it kee"}

Instead, sharks rely on a large liver filled with oil that contains squalene, and their cartilage, which is about half the normal density of bone.[38] Their liver constitutes up to 30% of their total body mass.[44] The liver's effectiveness is limited, so sharks employ dynamic lift to maintain depth while swimming. Sand tiger sharks store air in their stomachs, using it as a form of swim bladder.  Bottom-dwelling sharks, like the nurse shark, have negative buoyancy, allowing them to rest on the ocean floor.\nSome sharks, if inverted or stroked on the nose, enter a natural state of tonic immobility. Researchers use this condition to handle sharks safely.[45]\n\nRespiration\nLike other fish, sharks extr"}
{"text": "act oxygen from seawater as it passes over their gills. Unlike other fish, shark gill slits are not covered, but lie in a row behind the head. A modified slit called a spiracle lies just behind the eye, which assists the shark with taking in water during respiration and plays a major role in bottom\u2013dwelling sharks. Spiracles are reduced or missing in active pelagic sharks.[33] While the shark is moving, water passes through the mouth and over the gills in a process known as \"ram ventilation\". While at rest, most sharks pump water over their gills to ensure a constant supply of oxygenated water. A small number of species have lost the ability to pump water through their gills and must swim without rest. These species are obligate ram ventilators and would presumably asphyxiate if unable to move. Obligate ram ventilation is also true of some pelagic bony fish species.[46][47]\nThe respiration and circulation process begins when deoxygenated blood travels to the shark's two-chambered heart."}
{"text": " Here the shark pumps blood to its gills via the ventral aorta artery where it branches into afferent brachial arteries. Reoxygenation takes place in the gills and the reoxygenated blood flows into the efferent brachial arteries, which come together to form the dorsal aorta. The blood flows from the dorsal aorta throughout the body. The deoxygenated blood from the body then flows through the posterior cardinal veins and enters the posterior cardinal sinuses. From there blood enters the heart ventricle and the cycle repeats.[48]\n\nThermoregulation\nMost sharks are \"cold-blooded\" or, more precisely, poikilothermic, meaning that their internal body temperature matches that of their ambient environment. Members of the family Lamnidae (such as the shortfin mako shark and the great white shark) are homeothermic and maintain a higher body temperature than the surrounding water. In these sharks, a strip of aerobic red muscle located near the center of the body generates the heat, which the body r"}

The common thresher and bigeye thresher sharks have a similar mechanism for maintaining an elevated body temperature.[49]\n\nOsmoregulation\nIn contrast to bony fish, with the exception of the coelacanth,[50] the blood and other tissue of sharks and Chondrichthyes is generally isotonic to their marine environments because of the high concentration of urea (up to 2.5%[51]) and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), allowing them to be in osmotic balance with the seawater. This adaptation prevents most sharks from surviving in freshwater, and they are therefore confined to marine environments. A few exceptions exist, such as the bull shark, which has developed a way to change its kidney function to excrete large amounts of urea.[44] When a shark dies, the urea is broken down to ammonia by bacteria, causing the dead body to gradually smell strongly of ammonia.[52][53]\nResearch in 1"}

Smith showed that sharks' urine doesn't contain sufficient sodium to avoid hypernatremia, and it was postulated that there must be an additional mechanism for salt secretion. In 1960 it was discovered at the Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory in Salsbury Cove, Maine that sharks have a type of salt gland located at the end of the intestine, known as the \"rectal gland\", whose function is the secretion of chlorides.[54]\n\nDigestion\nDigestion can take a long time. The food moves from the mouth to a J-shaped stomach, where it is stored and initial digestion occurs.[55] Unwanted items may never get past the stomach, and instead the shark either vomits or turns its stomachs inside out and ejects unwanted items from its mouth.[56]\nOne of the biggest differences between the digestive systems of sharks and mammals is that sharks have much shorter intestines. This short length is achieved by the spiral valve with multiple turns within a single short section instead of a long "}

The valve provides a long surface area, requiring food to circulate inside the short gut until fully digested, when remaining waste products pass into the cloaca.[55]\n\nFluorescence\nA few sharks appear fluorescent under blue light, such as the swell shark and the chain catshark, where the fluorophore derives from a metabolite of kynurenic acid.[57]\n\nSenses\nSmell\n The shape of the hammerhead shark's head may enhance olfaction by spacing the nostrils further apart.\nSharks have keen olfactory senses, located in the short duct (which is not fused, unlike bony fish) between the anterior and posterior nasal openings, with some species able to detect as little as one part per million of blood in seawater.[58] The size of the olfactory bulb varies across different shark species, with size dependent on how much a given species relies on smell or vision to find their prey.[59] In environments with low visibility, shark species generally have larger olfactory bulbs.[59] In reef"}
{"text": "s, where visibility is high, species of sharks from the family Carcharhinidae have smaller olfactory bulbs.[59] Sharks found in deeper waters also have larger olfactory bulbs.[60]\nSharks have the ability to determine the direction of a given scent based on the timing of scent detection in each nostril.[61] This is similar to the method mammals use to determine direction of sound.\nThey are more attracted to the chemicals found in the intestines of many species, and as a result often linger near or in sewage outfalls.

To protect their eyes some species have nictitating membranes. This membrane covers the eyes while hunting and when the shark is being attacked. However, some species, including the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), do not have this membrane, but instead roll their eyes backwards to protect them when striking prey. The importance of sight in shark hunting behavior is debated. Some believe that electro- and chemoreception are more significant, while others point to the nictating membrane as evidence that sight is important. Presumably, the shark would not protect its eyes were they unimportant. The use of sight probably varies with species and water conditions. The shark's fi"}

In some species, females have evolved thicker skin to withstand these bites.[79]\n\nAsexual\nThere have been a number of documented cases in which a female shark who has not been in contact with a male has conceived a pup on her own through parthenogenesis.[81][82] The details of this process are not well understood, but genetic fingerprinting showed that the pups had no paternal genetic contribution, ruling out sperm storage.

Asexual reproduction may have contributed to the blue shark's decline off the Irish coast.[83]\n\nBrooding\nSharks display three ways to bear their young, varying by species, oviparity, viviparity and ovoviviparity.[84][85]\n\nOvoviviparity\nMost sharks are ovoviviparous, meaning that the eggs hatch in the oviduct within the mother's body and that the egg's yolk and fluids secreted by glands in the walls of the oviduct nourishes the embryos. The young continue to be nourished by the remnants of the yolk and the oviduct's fluids. As in viviparity, the young are born alive and fully functional. Lamniforme sharks practice oophagy, where the first embryos to hatch eat the remaining eggs.  Taking this a step further, sand tiger shark pups cannibalistically consume "}
{"text": "neighboring embryos.  The survival strategy for ovoviviparous species is to brood the young to a comparatively large size before birth. The whale shark is now classified as ovoviviparous rather than oviparous, because extrauterine eggs are now thought to have been aborted. Most ovoviviparous sharks give birth in sheltered areas, including bays, river mouths and shallow reefs. They choose such areas for protection from predators (mainly other sharks) and the abundance of food. Dogfish have the longest known gestation period of any shark, at 18 to 24 months. Basking sharks and frilled sharks appear to have even longer gestation periods, but accurate data are lacking.[84]\n\nOviparity\nSome species are oviparous, laying their fertilized eggs in the water. In most oviparous shark species, an egg case with the consistency of leather protects the developing embryo(s). These cases may be corkscrewed into crevices for protection. The egg case is commonly called a mermaid's purse. Oviparous sharks "}
{"text": "include the horn shark, catshark, Port Jackson shark, and swellshark.[84][86]\n\nViviparity\nViviparity is the gestation of young without the use of a traditional egg, and results in live birth.[87] Viviparity in sharks can be placental or aplacental.[87] Young are born fully formed and self-sufficient.[87] Hammerheads, the requiem sharks (such as the bull and blue sharks), and smoothhounds are viviparous.[76][84]\n\nBehavior\nThe classic view describes a solitary hunter, ranging the oceans in search of food. However, this applies to only a few species. Most live far more social, sedentary, benthic lives, and appear likely to have their own distinct personalities.[88] Even solitary sharks meet for breeding or at rich hunting grounds, which may lead them to cover thousands of miles in a year.[89] Shark migration patterns may be even more complex than in birds, with many sharks covering entire ocean basins.\nSharks can be highly social, remaining in large schools.

For example, oceanic whitetip sharks dominate silky sharks of comparable size during feeding.[76]\nWhen approached too closely some sharks perform a threat display. This usually consists of exaggerated swimming movements, and can vary in intensity according to the threat level.[90]\n\nSpeed\nIn general, sharks swim (\"cruise\") at an average speed of 8 kilometres per hour (5.0\u00a0mph), but when feeding or attacking, the average shark can reach speeds upwards of 19 kilometres per hour (12\u00a0mph). The shortfin mako shark, the fastest shark and one of the fastest fish, can burst at speeds up to 50 kilometres per hour (31\u00a0mph).[91] The great white shark is also capable of speed bursts. These exceptions may be due to the warm-blooded, or homeothermic, nature of these sharks' physiology. Sharks can travel 70 to 80\u00a0km in a day.[92]\n\nIntelligence\nSharks possess brain-to-body"}

Those that are able to breathe while not swimming do so by using their spiracles to force water over their gills, thereby allowing them to extract oxygen from the water. It has been recorded that their eyes remain open while in this state and actively follow the movements of divers swimming around them[97] and as such they are not truly asleep.\nSpecies that do need to swim continuously to breathe go through a process known as sleep swimming, in which the shark is essentially unconscious.

For the sport of shark feeding, see Shark baiting.\nMost sharks are carnivorous.[99] Basking sharks, whale sharks, and megamouth sharks have independently evolved different strategies for filter feeding plankton: basking sharks practice ram feeding, whale sharks use suction to take in plankton and small fishes, and megamouth sharks make suction feeding more efficient by using the luminescent tissue inside of their mouths to attract prey in the deep ocean. This type of feeding requires gill rakers\u2014long, slender filaments that form a very efficient sieve\u2014analogous to the baleen plates of the great whales.

Cookiecutter teeth are enormous compared to the animal's size. The lower teeth are particularly sharp. Although they have never been observed feeding, they are believed to latch onto their prey and use their thick lips to make a seal, twisting their bodies to rip off flesh.[44]\nSome seabed\u2013dwelling species are highly effective ambush predators.

These social sharks are often migratory, traveling huge distances around ocean basins in large schools. These migrations may be partly necessary to find new food sources.[101]\n\nRange and habitat\nSharks are found in all seas. They generally do not live in fresh water, with a few exceptions such as the bull shark and the river shark which can swim both in seawater and freshwater.[102] Sharks are common down to depths of 2,000 metres (7,000\u00a0ft), and som"}

Jaws author Peter Benchley, as well as Jaws director Steven Spielberg, later attempted to dispel the image of sharks as man-eating monsters.[108]\nTo help avoid an unprovoked attack, humans should not wear jewelry or metal that is shiny and refrain from splashing around too much.[109]\nIn general, sharks show little pattern of attacking humans specifically.

This gave rise to the belief that sharks, as well as being difficult to capture and transport, were difficult to care for. More knowledge has led to more species (including the large pelagic sharks) living far longer in captivity, along with safer transportation techniques that have enabled long-distance transportation.[112] The great white shark had never been successfully held in captivity for long periods of time until September 2004, when the Monterey Bay Aquarium successfully kept a young female for 198 days before releasing her.\n\n A whale shark in Georgia Aquarium\nMost species are not suitable for home aquaria, and not every species sold by pet stores are appropriate.
